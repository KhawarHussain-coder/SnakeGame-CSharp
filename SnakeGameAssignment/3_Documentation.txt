⚙️ **Key Components**

1. **GameEngine.cs** (Core Logic)
- Manages game state and rules
- Handles collision detection
- Controls speed and level progression
- Manages score calculations
2. **MainForm.cs** (UI Controller)
- Windows Forms interface
- Event handling for controls
- Game visualization and rendering
- Settings management
3. **Snake.cs** (Snake Object)
- Stores snake position and segments
- Handles movement and growth
- Manages self-collision detection
4. **Food.cs** (Food System)
- Four food types: Normal, Bonus, Fast, Slow
- Different point values and effects
- Student-themed naming system

🎯 Design Choices
1. **Educational Theme**
- **Snake named "Teacher"**
- **Food items named after students** (Student A, B, C, D)
- **Learning progression** through levels
2. **Dual High Score System**
- **All-time High Score**: Saved to file (persistent)
- **Session High Score**: Current play session only
- **Visual differentiation** between the two
3. **Speed Management**
- **Base speed** decreases with each level
- **Temporary speed effects** from special foods
- **Balanced progression** for fair gameplay
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Decoupled game logic** from UI
- **Clean separation** of concerns
- **Easy maintenance** and extensibility
